# GAO Compliance Checker (GCC)
Currently, there is no automated method for determining the compliance of DHS AI/ML systems against GAO's AI Accountability Framework â€“ despite the fact that GAO is already conducting audits of DHS AI/ML systems based on its Audit Procedures. This tool could be used by AI/ML system owners, DHS CTOD, and even GAO for performing preliminary compliance checks.
